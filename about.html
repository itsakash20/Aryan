          <p>
            People for Animals, Mysuru (PFA Mysuru) is a grassroots, non-profit organization dedicated to improving the lives of domestic animals in Mysuru district, Karnataka.

We take pride in being the first responders for sick, injured and abandoned animals. As a no-kill shelter, we’ve helped over 70,000 animals since our inception in 2010. To date, we’ve helped over 15 species of domestic animals. The stray dog is our most common patient, but PFA Mysuru has helped a wide variety of species.

                  <h3>Our Social Work</h3>
                  <p>Work Animal Birth Control: Animal birth control is one of the largest tasks that we do at PFA Mysuru. Given the increase in stray animal populations, it’s imperative that their numbers be kept in check so as to not cause harm to Mysuru’s residents and also to themselves. In partnership with the Mysuru City Corporation, and with the help of our gracious donor network, we sterilise approximately 5000 animals every year.
                    
                    Animal shelters: The PFA Mysuru campus can host up to 400 animals at any given time. We have separate facilities for injured animals, animals affected with rabies, sterilised animals, puppies, a cat section, a section for large mammals, a trough for pigs, a separate section for rabbits, and also have some extra space for future expansion.
                    
                    Rabies vaccination: Rabies is another significant public healthcare crisis, with India reporting over 22,00,000 dog bites in the past year alone. To help reduce the effects of this health crisis, PFA Mysuru administers anti-rabies vaccines to every animal that comes to our hospital, every day. We’ve vaccinated nearly as many animals as we’ve taken in, over the past 15 years.
                    
                    Medical Assistance: PFA Mysuru handles medical cases (both inpatient and OPD) for animals that need the assistance.me within Mysuru city. Through regular adoption drives, and updates on our social media platforms, we’ve helped nearly 2000 animals get adopted in the course of our operations.</p>
